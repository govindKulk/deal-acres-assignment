Typically, you can expect to pay around one month’s rent or a percentage of one year’s rent. So if you rent an apartment in Tallahassee for $2,000 a month, you could pay anywhere between $2,000 to $2,400 if the agent takes 10% of the annual rent. However, practices can differ from region to region, so clarifying the terms and fees with the agent before entering into any agreements is essential. Consulting with the agent or agency upfront will help you understand the cost structure and any potential fees associated with their services in your market.",
